/* motion.js: J and Z, the two letters that are MOVEMENTS (and, in the numbers build, TEN).
 *
 * Every other letter is a handshape held still, graded by the model. J is an
 * I (pinky out) that draws a J in the air; Z is an index finger that draws a
 * Z. There is no public data of either as landmark sequences, so this is a
 * RULE, stated in numbers, not a trained model:
 *
 *   shape  a finger is "out" when its tip is at least EXT times as far from
 *          the wrist as its knuckle, "curled" when at most CURL times. On the
 *          owner's recorded holds straight fingers read 1.49-2.05 and curled
 *          ones 0.38-1.13 (research/allletters-2026-09-22/).
 *            J: pinky out; index, middle, ring curled.
 *            Z: index out; middle, ring, pinky curled.
 *   motion over the frames in that shape during the few seconds before the
 *          hand came to rest, the moving fingertip (smoothed) must have:
 *            J: travelled at least J_DROP palm-lengths down and J_HOOK across.
 *            Z: spanned Z_WIDTH across and Z_DROP down, and reversed its
 *               sideways direction at least twice (right, back, right).
 *
 * Palm-length = wrist to middle knuckle, so the rule does not care how far
 * the hand is from the camera. The movement is checked on every frame of a J
 * or Z trial and a recognised one is the answer at once, with no hold
 * (experiments/asl-tutor/engine.js, JT 2026-09-24); holding still is only the
 * fallback that grades a movement that was not recognised.
 *
 * TEN (the numbers build, tools/build-mobile-site.sh --set numbers) is a thumbs-up given a small twist or shake:
 *   shape  index, middle, ring and pinky curled (as above), the thumb out of the fist (its tip at least T10_THUMB
 *          palm-lengths from the index knuckle: on FSboard's Deaf signers an S reads 0.20 at the median, an A 0.51,
 *          an L 0.85; research/numbers-2026-10-24/thumb_measure.py) and pointing up (within T10_UP_DEG of straight up).
 *   motion the thumb swings: its direction turns through T10_TWIST_DEG and back (a twist), or its tip goes
 *          T10_SHAKE palm-lengths sideways and back (a shake). Either one counts; holding still does not.
 *
 * ELEVEN, TWELVE, FIFTEEN (the numbers build) are fingers that FLICK or BEND, over and over, while the hand stays put:
 *   11  the index flicks up from under the thumb; middle, ring and pinky stay curled.
 *   12  the index and middle fingers flick up together; ring and pinky stay curled.
 *   15  a 5 (thumb out) whose four fingers bend down at the knuckles together.
 *   shape  the fingers that do not move curled (at most FLICK_STILL: looser than CURL, since a curled finger next to
 *          one flicking reads up to 1.35, and 1.49 for a moment as the flick goes by); for 15, the thumb out (T10_THUMB).
 *   motion the moving fingers (11 the index, 12 index and middle, 15 all four) go from straight (all of them at least
 *          FLICK_UP) to bent (all of them at most FLICK_DOWN; for 15, three of the four, as the pinky bends least) or
 *          back at least FLICK_FLIPS times: up, down, up, or down, up, down. A finger that only wobbles between the
 *          two (a tracking glitch, a curled finger turned with the hand) never counts.
 *          Measured on Learn How to Sign's videos of 11, 12 and 15 (research/numbers-2026-10-24/FLICKS.md): the index
 *          reads 1.1-1.3 under the thumb and 2.0-2.2 flicked up; 12's lower finger 1.3-1.6 and 2.1-2.5; 15's lowest
 *          2.0-2.2 open, its third-lowest 1.35-1.46 bent (seen from the front). A curled index turned with a twisting
 *          10 swings 0.46 but never reaches 1.75. */
